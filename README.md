# Adding React to Vanilla JS Applications

[Link to the Site](https://dalecb13.github.io/add-react-component-example/)

## Summary

This repo goes over examples on how to add React into an existing HTML/JS/CSS application.

Fortunately software developers are lazy and tend to like to automate things, so they built all of these tools to make their lives easier. If you can find what most web pages looked like in the early days, we've come a long way. However there's an issue that you've probably also seen in academia: in order to get to the cutting-edge knowledge, you should be familiar enough with EVERYTHING that lead up to it. This will hopefully serve as a bridge so you can be lazier in your life.

## Examples

* Adding a reusable React component
  * [Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html)
  * [TBD]
* Using JSX in a React component
  * [Reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#optional-try-react-with-jsx)
  * [TBD]
* Next Steps
  * Full blown React Project?

### Full-blown React Project

This might sound like a sales pitch, but raw JavaScript can be pretty powerful. However it is also wasteful to write it at a human-readable level. You can take advantage of tools like Babel, Webpack, React, Vue, Angular, and others to improve the performance of your site's user experience. For example, if you have a ton of data loaded into the browser, and you want to change how it is displayed on the screen based on user's inputs, it might make sense to "pre-compile" or translate your human-readable code into a sleeker syntax still legible by the browser.
